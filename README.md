# CSharp_FayeKeyILS
Database final project

The Faye Key Public Library (FKPL) currently has no way to manage their patrons and items. 
Books often go missing or are unaccounted for, and patrons are not verified as being eligible to check out library materials. 
FKPL has contracted Totally Real Database Solutions to create an Integrated Library System (ILS) for the small public library. 
This system will rely on a database to track patrons and materials, both in the library and outside it.

The system shall keep track of library materials and library patrons. 
The system will also create relationships between those two tables, so library staff can see if items are checked out and which patron they are checked out to.

The system will contain a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) listing either all patrons or all items, and show the relationship between those two. 
For instance, clicking on a patron will list all the items they have checked out, while clicking on an item will display the patron who currently has that item checked out.  
The system will also allow for the creation of new items and patrons.
